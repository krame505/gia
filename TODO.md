Near-term TODO items
====================
* Generic typing
* Type-check overloaded operators
* Fix hacks with resolving recursive typing
* Fix bugs with run-time errors not being 'bubbled up' to the top level
* Re-think recursive values - should decls be fully recursive?  
* Set syntax is annoying
* Finish incomplete pp - low priority

Long-range TODO items
=====================
* IDE
* Improve/fix REPL environment
  * Use nailgun for speed-up
  * Bugs with syntax errors in decls kind of breaking the session
