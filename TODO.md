====================
* Type-check overloaded operators
* Fix hacks with resolving recursive typing
* Re-think recursive values - should decls be fully recursive?  
* Better errors for incompatible fields
* Set syntax is annoying
* Finish incomplete pp - low priority

Long-range TODO items
=====================
* IDE
* Improve/fix REPL environment
  * Use nailgun for speed-up
